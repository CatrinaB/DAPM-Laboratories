# DAPM-Laboratories
Laboratories for "Development of Applications for Mobile Platforms" ("DÃ©veloppement d'applications pour plateformes mobiles") course.

The labs are a series of very simple Android apps developed in Java and Ionic.

## Lab 01
The lab was mostly dedicated to setting up Android Studio and getting used to the main concepts (activities, layout).

## Lab 02
Very basic app that illustrates the use of toasts and the different levels of logs (debug, verbose, warning, error).

## Lab 03
The app generates a random number between 0 and 100. The user tries to guess the number by typing it, and the app will display a "Higher" or "Lower" message depending if the generated number is higher or, respectively, lower than the one typed by the user. This process repeats until the number is guessed, when a new number will be generated and the game starts again.

## Lab 04
The user has to login first (user: student, pass: student; predefined in code). Then they will be able to play a tic-tac-toe game against another user (using the same phone) until one of them wins or it's a draw.

## Lab 05
An empty list of cars. The user can add new cars by typing their name in the text field and hitting the adjacent button. Screenshots in folder's README file.

## Lab 06
The lab illustrates the use of Android SharedPreferences; details in the folder's README file.

## Lab 07
The lab consisted of two exercises. The first illustrates the use of Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionalities in Android: the user taps the microphone button, records an audio that is displayed as text, and then they ca listen to the displayed text by clicking the "Listen" button. The second exercise illustrates a very basic use of fragments. More details in the folder's README file.

## Lab 08
This lab introduced Firebase Authentication, or more precisely, creating an account through the Firebase API. It also introduces using an external database management system (in this case, SQLite) for storing, updating and deleting data.

## Lab 10
An app that allows the user to access the phone's camera, take a picture and save it, displaying it in the photo gallery of the app; developed in Ionic.
